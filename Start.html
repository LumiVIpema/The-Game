<h1>Those whom  hast died, I greet thou at the gates of the 9 rings of hell</h1>
<p>Oh no, how unfortunate... you died didnt you? What a shame, such a young soul wasted with sins. <br>
Yes sins, I know what you are, but worry not! <br>
You would think this is the end right? well think again you get one last chance.<br>
Prove yourself in my 9 rings of hell mortal, and those who are worthy may walk into heaven as a pure being.<br>
But be warned, if you fail in one of the rings you will be stuck there for eternity!<br>
<br>
Enter the ring, lets see how worthy you are.</p>
